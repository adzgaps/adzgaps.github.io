              The Philippines; Filipino: Pilipinas,officially the Republic of
              the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas),[e] is an
              archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. In the western Pacific
              Ocean, it consists of 7,641 islands which are broadly categorized
              in three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon,
              Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South
              China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the
              Celebes Sea to the southwest. It shares maritime borders with
              Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and
              southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia to the southwest,
              Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. It is the world's
              thirteenth-most-populous country, with diverse ethnicities and
              cultures. Manila is the country's capital, and its largest city is
              Quezon City; both are within Metro Manila. Negritos, the
              archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by waves of
              Austronesian peoples. The adoption of Animism, Hinduism and Islam
              established island-kingdoms ruled by datus, rajas, and sultans.
              The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a
              fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In
              1543, Spanish explorer Ruy LÃ³pez de Villalobos named the
              archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain.
              Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the
              Philippines becoming ruled by the Spanish Empire for more than 300
              years. Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became
              the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. The Philippine Revolution
              began in 1896, which became entwined with the 1898
              Spanish-American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United
              States, and Filipino revolutionaries declared the First Philippine
              Republic. The ensuing Philippine-American War ended with the
              United States controlling the territory until the Japanese
              invasion of the islands during World War II. After liberation, the
              Philippines became independent in 1946. The unitary sovereign
              state has had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which
              included the overthrow of a decades-long dictatorship in a
              nonviolent revolution. The Philippines is an emerging market and a
              newly industrialized country, whose economy is transitioning from
              being agricultural to service- and manufacturing-centered. It is a
              founding member of the United Nations, the World Trade
              Organization, ASEAN, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
              and the East Asia Summit; it is a major non-NATO ally of the
              United States. Its location as an island country on the Pacific
              Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes it prone to
              earthquakes and typhoons. The Philippines has a variety of natural
              resources and a globally-significant level of biodiversity.
